## 📂 Repository Structure

`notebook/logic/` Contains guided notes with sample code and commentary. Each notebook introduces a new concept and demonstrates how it applies to real-world systems programming and secure software design.

`notebook/tasks/` Contains challenge notes. These are designed to help you practice, solve problems, and build your own implementations after studying the logic lessons.

`notebook/tools/` Contains Python scripts used to work on the notebook.

`subprojects/` Contains wrap files needed for the lessons.

## 🚀 Getting Started
	
Clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/fossillogic/notebook.git
cd <repo>
```

Open the notebooks with VSCode:

```zsh
code .
```

Explore the notebook/logic folder first for guided learning, then attempt the challenges in notebook/tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

Each notebook includes:

	•	Annotated Samples — clear, step-by-step code examples
	•	Deep Comments — contextual explanations with reasoning
	•	Practical Tasks — exercises that challenge your understanding

The goal is not just to write code but to understand why it works, how it scales, and what makes it secure and reliable.

⸻

## 🧩 Example Flow

	1.	Study a concept in notebook/logic
	2.	Review the comments and examples carefully
	3.	Move to a challenge in notebook/tasks
	4.	Implement your solution and compare with references

⸻

## 🔒 Philosophy

At Fossil Learning, every experiment is built with:
	•	Truth — clarity and correctness in code and explanation
	•	Security — strong foundations to avoid pitfalls and vulnerabilities
	•	Transparency — deeply documented steps for full traceability
